# Memorial Mosaic

## Project Overview
Memorial Mosaic is an AI-guided platform that helps users create comprehensive digital memorials through modular, personalized "tiles" that form a complete picture of a person's life. The AI acts as both curator and guide, helping contributors create meaningful tributes based on their unique relationship to the memorialized person.

## Prototype
This repository contains a clickable prototype that demonstrates the core concept of Memorial Mosaic. The prototype showcases:

- AI-guided conversation flow for collecting memories and stories
- Different memorial objects (tiles) selected based on user relationships
- The concept of building a comprehensive memorial through multiple perspectives
- Configurable conversation scripts that can be selected and played
