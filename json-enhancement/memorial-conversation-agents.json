Second, an interactive timeline showing his journey as a professor, father, and husband with carefully selected photos and stories. Third, a collection of 'Ramon-isms' - those phrases, jokes, or pieces of advice he was known for. And finally, a collaborative memory wall where family, friends, colleagues, and students can add their own stories. How does this sound to you?",
